High-Level Architecture for a Highly Available Trading System on AWS

1. User Access Layer
AWS CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN) to accelerate UI/UX performance by caching content closer to users
Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services, ensuring even load balancing and fault tolerance
Amazon API Gateway: Handles REST and WebSocket API requests for real-time trading updates, providing authentication, throttling, and monitoring

2. Backend Services Layer
AWS Lambda: Event-driven microservices for lightweight, scalable functions such as order validation and notifications
AWS Fargate: Runs containerized trading engine and supporting microservices, eliminating the need to manage infrastructure
Amazon SQS: Message queue for asynchronous order processing, improving system decoupling and scalability
Amazon EventBridge: Event bus for real-time event-driven architecture, enabling seamless integration between services

3. Database & Storage Layer
Amazon DynamoDB: Stores real-time order books and user sessions with high-speed read/write capabilities
DynamoDB On-Demand Mode: Adjusts capacity automatically based on workload demand, ensuring cost-effective scalability
Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL: Stores historical transactions, account balances, and trade records with high availability and strong consistency
Aurora Read Replicas: Enhances read scalability by offloading read traffic from the primary Aurora database
Amazon S3: Stores trade logs, backups, and static assets efficiently with high durability
AWS Glacier: Cost-effective long-term archival storage for historical trading data and log

4. Security & Monitoring
AWS WAF: Protects against common web threats, such as SQL injection and XSS attacks
AWS Shield: Provides DDoS protection for critical applications and APIs
Amazon GuardDuty: Continuously monitors and detects potential security threats and anomalies
AWS CloudTrail: Logs all API requests and changes to resources for compliance and auditing
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors application performance and logs metrics for system health
AWS X-Ray: Traces requests across services for debugging and performance optimization.

5. Scaling Strategy
Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically scales AWS Fargate tasks and ALB targets based on demand
Read Replicas in Amazon Aurora: Enhances database performance by distributing read queries across multiple replicas
DynamoDB On-Demand Mode: Ensures cost-effective scalability by adjusting capacity dynamically
AWS Global Accelerator: Optimizes network traffic for reduced latency and improved availability across AWS regions
